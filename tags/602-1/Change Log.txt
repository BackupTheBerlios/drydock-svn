0.06 (v602-1)
	• Compare dialog implemented.
	• Implemented Scale tool.
	• Changed bundle identifier. This will result in preferences being reset.
	• Internal restructuring & bug fixes.

0.05 (v601-4)
	• Generalised Undo support in twenty minutes. Cocoa rules. (Admittedly I spent several hours
	  yesterday making meshes copiable and wouldn’t be able to do this otherwise, but still.)
	• Implemented new system for gathering and reporting “issues” – diagnostic notes, warnings and
	  errors regarding (for now) opening and saving.
	• Added Recentre and Flip commands.

0.04 (v601-3)
	• OBJ imporing.
	• Added triangulation support. DAT files are now always saved triangulated, but you can do it
	  explicitly from the Tools menu if that’s your idea of fun.
	• Corrected loading of non-72-dpi textures.
	• “Show” menu item status now updated correctly.
	• You can no longer get more than one Open panel by re-activating the application.
	• Began work on Compare window.
	• Wireframe mode always uses yellow instead of face colour (which is otherwise ignored).
	• Slightly less efficient texture loading which is not dependant on Tiger – this will make it
	  into Oolite at some point.
	• Lots of texturing changes that aren’t actually used, but will be rolled into Oolite at some
	  point.
	• Improved several icons.
	• Internal infrastructure changes. Next version should be able to undo all destructive changes.

0.03 (v601-2)
	• No more pointless empty documents - brings up an Open dialog instead. Disabled equally
	  pointless New command.
	• Universal build. Does it work on Intel-based Macs?
	• Rotating things a lot no longer deforms them in interesting ways.
	• Once again rotate model to an interesting display angle on loading.
	• Consistently scale light position feedback thing.
	• You can no longer switch off both wireframe and face rendering.

0.02 (v601-1)
	• Much-improved “virtual joystick” rotation. Trust me, this is good.
	• Error message instead of crash on pre-Tiger systems.
	• Feedback when rotating lights.
	• Reimplemented dragging (whee). The Rotate tool now works for general camera manipulation.
	  With rotate tool selected:
		- Dragging rotates the model.
		- Shift-dragging rotates the lights.
		- Command-dragging zooms.
	  With any tool selected, the same actions are available by using the option key or the right
	  mouse button. (May change to third button if I implement contextual menus in 3D view.)
	  Additionally, a (vertical) scroll wheel always zooms.
	• Got an icon (thanks, Murgh).
	• Added version checking.
