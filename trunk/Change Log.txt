0.07 (v602-2)
	• Added OBJ export support.
	• As side effect of testing OBJ export, fixed potential crasher in OBJ import (malformed files
	  could specify out-of-range indices which weren’t corrected properly).
	• Added Smart Crash Reports support – if SCR is installed and Dry Dock crashes, the option is
	  given to mail me the crash log. The option is provided to install SCR the first time you run
	  Dry Dock. If you say no, you won’t be asked again. If you say yes, you will be asked again if
	  SCR is removed. Nothing is installed behind your back, so please don’t include me in any SCR-
	  bashing you feel like engaging on, m’kay?
	• First-run “wizard” added. Asks previously-mentioned question regarding Smart Crash Reports,
	  and (for first-time users) takes over the responsiblity of asking about version checks more
	  elegantly than the old alert.
	• Changed automatic check-for-update frequency from once every ten days to once every two days.

0.06 (v602-1)
	• Compare dialog implemented.
	• Implemented Scale tool.
	• Changed bundle identifier. This will result in preferences being reset.
	• Internal restructuring & bug fixes.

0.05 (v601-4)
	• Generalised Undo support in twenty minutes. Cocoa rules. (Admittedly I spent several hours
	  yesterday making meshes copiable and wouldn’t be able to do this otherwise, but still.)
	• Implemented new system for gathering and reporting “issues” – diagnostic notes, warnings and
	  errors regarding (for now) opening and saving.
	• Added Recentre and Flip commands.

0.04 (v601-3)
	• OBJ imporing.
	• Added triangulation support. DAT files are now always saved triangulated, but you can do it
	  explicitly from the Tools menu if that’s your idea of fun.
	• Corrected loading of non-72-dpi textures.
	• “Show” menu item status now updated correctly.
	• You can no longer get more than one Open panel by re-activating the application.
	• Began work on Compare window.
	• Wireframe mode always uses yellow instead of face colour (which is otherwise ignored).
	• Slightly less efficient texture loading which is not dependant on Tiger – this will make it
	  into Oolite at some point.
	• Lots of texturing changes that aren’t actually used, but will be rolled into Oolite at some
	  point.
	• Improved several icons.
	• Internal infrastructure changes. Next version should be able to undo all destructive changes.

0.03 (v601-2)
	• No more pointless empty documents - brings up an Open dialog instead. Disabled equally
	  pointless New command.
	• Universal build. Does it work on Intel-based Macs?
	• Rotating things a lot no longer deforms them in interesting ways.
	• Once again rotate model to an interesting display angle on loading.
	• Consistently scale light position feedback thing.
	• You can no longer switch off both wireframe and face rendering.

0.02 (v601-1)
	• Much-improved “virtual joystick” rotation. Trust me, this is good.
	• Error message instead of crash on pre-Tiger systems.
	• Feedback when rotating lights.
	• Reimplemented dragging (whee). The Rotate tool now works for general camera manipulation.
	  With rotate tool selected:
		- Dragging rotates the model.
		- Shift-dragging rotates the lights.
		- Command-dragging zooms.
	  With any tool selected, the same actions are available by using the option key or the right
	  mouse button. (May change to third button if I implement contextual menus in 3D view.)
	  Additionally, a (vertical) scroll wheel always zooms.
	• Got an icon (thanks, Murgh).
	• Added version checking.
