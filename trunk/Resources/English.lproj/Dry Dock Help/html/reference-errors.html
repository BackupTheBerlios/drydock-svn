<div id="content"><h1>Errors and Warnings Reference</h1>
<p>Many operations in Dry Dock may present errors, warnings or notes, or a combination thereof,
using a “Problem Report” dialogue box as pictured below.</p>

<div class="image-main">

<p>Figure 1. A typical Problem Report dialogue box.</p>
</div>

<p>This help page presents examples of the most common types of errors, and explains why they
arise.</p>

<!-- Doesn’t work properly in Tiger.
<div class="tip"><div class="label">Tip!</div>
You can look up an error message in Help by selecting it in the Problem Report
dialogue box, and pressing the Help button in the lower-left corner.</div>
-->

<p>If this help page does provide the information required to solve a problem, you may
wish to send a bug report or request help <a href="mailto:Jens Ayton
&lt;UMHMLDIZEYNZ@spammotel.com&gt;">by e-mail</a>. In this case, note that you can select one or
more messages in the Problem Report dialogue box and copy them (using the <span
class="command-name">Copy</span> command in the <span class="command-name">Edit</span> menu).</p>

<h2>Warnings and Notes</h2>
<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-nonTriangularFaces"></a>
This document contains non-triangular faces. In order to save it in the selected format, Dry Dock
will triangulate it.</div>

<p>This message is presented when saving a document in Oolite DAT format, if it has faces with more
than three vertices. If you continue, the document will be converted to triangles before saving.
This is equivalent to selecting <span class="command-name">Triangulate</span> from the <span
class="command-name">Tools</span> menu.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-textureNotFound"></a>
No texture named “My Texture” could be found, using place-holder texture.</div>

<p>When opening a document, Dry Dock looks for textures in several locations:</p>

<ol>
	<li> In the same folder as the document.</li>
	<li> In a folder named “Textures” in the same folder as the document.</li>
	<li> In a folder named “Textures” in the folder containing the folder with the document.</li>
	<li> Inside the Oolite application, if it can be found.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the texture cannot be found in any of these locations, this message is displayed, and Dry Dock
will use the “place-holder” texture, which is a grey checked pattern.</p>

<div class="image-main">
<img src="../../../Placeholder Texture.png" alt="The place-holder texture." width="256" height="256" />
<p>Figure 2. The place-holder texture.</p>
</div>

<p>Note that Dry Dock will remember the name of the texture, and if you save the document and open
it again, Dry Dock will once again look for the correct texture. In other words, the document is not
damaged, only displayed incorrectly.</p>
</div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-multipleMaterialLibraries"></a>
The document contains multiple material library references. Currently, only one material library is
supported. Ignoring reference to material library “Second Material Library”.</div>

<p>WaveFront OBJ documents specify material properties, such as textures, in external files called
“material libraries” (which use the file name extension “.mtl”). Any OBJ document may refer to zero
or more material libraries. However, Dry Dock does not currently support more than one material
library. Therefore, this message will be displayed when attempting to open an OBJ document
which refers to more than one material library. The document can still be opened, but some textures
may be missing. It seems unlikely that this will be a problem working with models for Oolite, but if
it is, please <a href="mailto:Jens Ayton &lt;UMHMLDIZEYNZ@spammotel.com&gt;">e-mail a request</a> to
fix this.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-unknownOBJLineType"></a>
<a name="problem-ignoredOBJLineType"></a>
<a name="problem-OBJCall"></a>
<a name="problem-OBJShellScript"></a>
The document contains lines of type “cstype” (parametric curve/surface type), which will be
ignored.</div>

<p>WaveFront OBJ documents can contain a variety of geometry types and commands which Dry Dock
cannot presently handle, such as curved surfaces and references to other OBJ files. If you wish to
see a particular OBJ feature supported, please <a href="mailto:Jens Ayton
&lt;UMHMLDIZEYNZ@spammotel.com&gt;">e-mail a request</a>. Please attach example files if
possible.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-textureNotPowerOfTwo"></a>
The texture “My Texture” does not have power-of-two dimensions. It has been rescaled from 200 × 200
pixels to 256 × 256 pixels.</div>

<p>Like Oolite (and most 3D games), Dry Dock requires textures to have sides whose length in pixels
is a power of two. Dry Dock, like Oolite, will rescale textures if necessary to ensure this. Such
scaling wastes memory (both regular memory and graphics memory), so textures should be resized to
a resolution where such scaling is not needed. For Oolite, it is recommended that you do not use
textures larger than 512 × 512 pixels, and use 256 × 256 pixels if at all possible. Note that two
256 × 256 textures use half as much memory as one 512 × 512 texture!</p>

<p>Also note that different graphics cards have different size limits. Dry Dock will scale textures
down to the maximum size allowed by the graphics card if necessary. Oolite is currently not capable
of this, however.</p></div>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-allocFailed"></a>
A memory allocation failed. This is probably due to a memory shortage.</div>
<div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-textureFileNotLoadedMemory"></a>
The texture “My Texture” could not be loaded, because there was not enough memory.</div>

<p>These messages indicates that Dry Dock asked the system for some memory, and none was provided.
This generally means that both physical memory and your main hard disk (startup disk) are full. You
should free up hard disk space by removing unneeded files and emptying the Trash, and free up memory
by closing documents and quitting applications.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-noDataLoaded"></a>
No data could be loaded from “My Document”.</div>

<p>This error indicates that loading of a document failed. This could occur for a broad variety of
reasons, such as the file disappearing before Dry Dock attempts to open it, or the disk containing
the file being damaged. It generally does not indicate a problem with the contents of the file.
Depending on the precise nature of the problem, an additional explanation may be provided.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-noDATNVERTS"></a>
<a name="problem-noDATNFACES"></a>
<a name="problem-insufficientParts"></a>
<a name="problem-noVertexDataLoaded"></a>
<a name="problem-noSmoothingGroupLoaded"></a>
<a name="problem-noReservedFieldsLoaded"></a>
<a name="problem-noTextureNameLoaded"></a>
<a name="problem-noTextureScaleLoaded"></a>
<a name="problem-noUVLoaded"></a>
Vertex data could not be read for vertex line 37.</div>

<div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-invalidVertexIndex"></a>
<a name="problem-invalidNormalIndex"></a>
<a name="problem-invalidUVIndex"></a>
<a name="problem-vertexRange"></a>
<a name="problem-normalIndexRange"></a>
<a name="problem-UVIndexRange"></a>
Face 10 specifies a vertex index of 25, but there are only 24 vertices in the document.</div>

<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-vertexCountRange"></a>
Invalid vertex count (2) for face 84. Each face must have at least three and no more than 16
vertices.</div>

<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-parseError"></a>
Parse error on line 56: expected integer, got end of file.</div>

<p>These errors indicate specific problems loading Oolite DAT or WaveFront OBJ documents. Unless you
are editing them in a text editor, the differences are not important; they all mean that the document
is not valid.</p></div>

<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-tooManyVertices"></a>
<a name="problem-tooManyFaces"></a>
<a name="problem-tooManyMaterials"></a>
This document contains 602 faces; the selected format allows no more than 512.</div>

<p>This error occurs if you try to save a document in Oolite DAT format which is too complex for
Oolite to load. It is necessary to reduce the complexity of the model by simplifying it or by
dividing it into parts which can be joined together using the subentity system.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-invalidTextureName"></a>
This document contains a texture named “My Texture”. The specified format does not support
texture names containing spaces, commas, line breaks, “#” or “//”.</div>

<p>This error may occur when trying to save a document in Oolite DAT format. This format has
restrictions on allowable file names for textures, as detailed in the error message. For maximum
compatibility, it is recommended that you restrict yourself to texture names consisting of lowercase
letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.</p></div>

<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-writeFailed"></a>
The document could not be saved.</div>

<div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-mtllibWriteFailed"></a>
The material library for the document could not be saved.</div>

<p>This error indicates that something went wrong while trying to write the document to a disk, for
instance because you don’t have permission to write to the specified location or because the disk is
full. It does not indicate a problem in generating the contents of the file; it should be possible
to save the document to another location or a different disk. Depending on the precise nature of the
problem, an additional explanation may be provided.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-textureFileNotLoadedOSErr"></a>
The texture “My Texture” could not be loaded, because an error of type -42 occurred.</div>

<p>This error indicates that a texture could not be loaded. This could occur for a broad variety of
reasons, such as the file disappearing before Dry Dock attempts to open it, or the texture being of
a type not supported. (Dry Dock uses Quicktime to load textures, and thus supports many file types.
However, the recommended file format for textures is PNG.)</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-notValidDryDock"></a>
This is not a valid Dry Dock document.</div>
<div class="problem-quote"><a name="problem-outOfDateDryDock"></a>
This document appears to be generated by a newer version of Dry Dock; it is in an incompatible
format.</div>

<p>These errors indicate that a document appears to be a Dry Dock document but cannot be read as
such.</p></div>


<div class="problem-description"><div class="problem-quote">
<a name="problem-documentTooComplex"></a>
This document is too complex to be loaded by Dry Dock. Dry Dock cannot handle models with more than
65534 faces; this document has 100273.</div>

<p>Dry Dock is designed to handle relatively simple models. Oolite is incapable of loading models
with more than 320 vertices, 512 faces or 8 materials. Dry Dock relaxes these limits somewhat and
can handle up to 65534 of each. Note that multiple models can be joined together using the subentity
system.</p></div>
